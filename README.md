# Bounce 3d
## About
Make a ball bounce off all 6 walls of a cube.

The last time I did this demo it was in Pascal and Turtle Graphics!

This project uses three.js.
I.e. WebGL and GPUs.

## Current Status
The program does most of what I want.

I'd like to play with the lights and shadows and reflections more.
